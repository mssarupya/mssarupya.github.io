### Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 🩺💻

Preventing heart diseases has become more crucial than ever. Implementing good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can significantly enhance the research and prevention process, ensuring more people lead healthy lives. This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to predict heart diseases, providing accurate predictions that aid in proactive healthcare management.

#### Project Overview 📊🔍
This project involves the analysis of a heart disease patient dataset with meticulous data processing. Various Machine Learning models are trained and tested using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and an Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer implemented in Python. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient, turning it into a binary classification problem. Input features comprise a variety of parameters, while the target variable indicates whether heart disease is present or not.
